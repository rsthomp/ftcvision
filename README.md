This is the code for FTC #7172's OpenCV-based ball tracker, for the 2016-17 game, Velocity Vortex. Building off of the framework from FTC#7393's vision-based beacon scoring mechanism, this code allowed the robot to autonomously locate, retrieve, and score balls during the autonomous portion of the match. 

At the team's request, the code here is limited to the vision-relevant portions. It includes relevant files from 7393's framework, the image processing code (BlueResult and BlueFinder), the modified app (FTCRobotControllerActivity), and the code used in testing and competition (BlueDetectorOp and UUAuto). 

A video of the robot in action can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZa4K-fdIvg
